### Creating a Typeracer Bot (Oct 22 - Dec 14)
Starting from the basics of simulating keyboard input with Python to fully automating the bot using advanced automation tools, this workshop walks through the step-by-step process of creating a TypeRacer bot from scratch.

**Note: This workshop's intended purpose is to demonstrate Python's automation abilities rather than encourage cheating in TypeRacer.**
